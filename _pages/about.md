👨‍💻 I'm a senior year undergraduate at TAMU Kingsville.

🔬 My research interests are in sensor systems which encompass internet of things (IoT), edge computing, and embedded systems.

📡 Current summer research are in applications of signal and digital image processing.

⚙️ As a maker first and foremost, I aim to keep adding skills to my repertoire such as PCB design and power electronics. Who knows, I may dabble in RF one day!

📚 This site will primarily be a place to concentrate any notes or demonstrations as I work through my summer research internship with the McNair Scholars program.

This site is a work-in-progress.
